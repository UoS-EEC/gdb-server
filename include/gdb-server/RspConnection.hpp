//! Class implementing the RSP connection listener

//! RSP requests received from TCP/IP are queued on the output FIFO for
//! processing by the GDB server. Packets read from the input FIFO from the
//! GDB server are sent back via TCP/IP.

//! The packets are received serially, ie. a new packet is not sent until the
//! previous ones have been dealt with. Some packets need no reply, so they
//! will be sent one after the other. But for packets that need a reply (which
//! may be one or several packets), new packets are not sent until the reply
//! from the previous one is received.

//! The upshot of this is that we can avoid any risk of deadlock by always
//! giving priority to any outgoing reply packets.

//! Two threads are used, one to listen for TCP/IP connections from the
//! client, the other to look for FIFO packets from the GDB server to write
//! back to the client. Both must be non-blocking in the SystemC sense
//! (i.e. allow other SystemC threads to run).
